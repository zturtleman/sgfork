This page is bound to help you converting your old Smokin' Guns installation to SGFork.

= Details =
  * First, download the SGtoSGFork.sh script, that you can find here: http://sgfork.googlecode.com/files/SGtoSGFork.sh
Add your content here.
  * Use it by that way: sh SGtoSGFork.sh <Your home> <Your installation path>. For example, if "/home/user" is your home and "/home/user/smokinguns" your installation path, you'll have to type "sh SGtoSGFork.sh /home/user /home/user/smokinguns".
  * Have fun ;-).
