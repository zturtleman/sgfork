# Welcome to **SGFork** project! #

**SGFork** is a branch of the western-style game **Smokin' Guns**.

## Goals ##
  * Make game competitive.
  * Increase performance.
  * Extend server administration flexibility.
  * Improve visualization sequence.
  * Make source code readable.
  * Create documentation (how game is functioning to let every player be aware of it).
  * Have fun :)

Current stage of the project is closed afla-testing. That means only design team is testing all new functionality. If you want to participate in that testing read the wiki and Google documentation we've provided.
